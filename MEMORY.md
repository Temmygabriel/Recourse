# MEMORY.md — Recourse

Durable project memory. Read this first when resuming work. It records
**decisions and constraints**, not a work log — for "what happened when", see
[PROGRESS.md](./PROGRESS.md).

## What this is

**Recourse** — escrowed payments on Base that become refundable when a delivery
does not match what was promised. GenLayer's validator network decides whether
the promise was kept; Base moves the money.

- Hackathon: **GenLayer Agent Tank**, Track 4 — **Onchain Justice**
- Build window: Sept 3–17, 2026. **Submission deadline Sept 17, 2026.**
- Prize: share of 5% of all GenLayer Points
- Must be **original** — README must differentiate from Internet Court
- Required: public GitHub repo, demo video, README with an honest security model

## Hard constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|:--|:--|
| **Local machine** | 8 GB RAM, no significant compute. **Never run `npm install`, `next build`, `forge build`, or any other heavy job locally.** All heavy compute happens on GitHub Actions or Vercel. |
| **Local toolchain** | Node v24.14.0, npm 11.9.0, git 2.53.0. **No `gh` on `PATH`** — it is installed at `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Local\gh-install\bin\gh.exe`; call it by full path or prepend that directory to `PATH`. **No `winget`.** No Vercel CLI, no SSH keys, no git credential store. |
| **Deployment** | Vercel, connected via the Vercel dashboard to the GitHub repo (not the CLI). Vercel runs install+build in its own cloud. |
| **Chain** | Base **Sepolia** testnet only. No mainnet, no real funds, ever, in this build. |
| **GenLayer** | Consensus **v0.6** / Studio **v0.123** release family. See below. |

## Decisions already made (do not relitigate without asking)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|:--|:--|:--|
| D1 | **Escrow token = real Base Sepolia USDC** (`0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e`) | User's explicit choice. Requires faucet funds per demo run. |
| D2 | **Vercel deploys via dashboard repo-connect** | Zero compute on the 8 GB machine. |
| D3 | **Solidity has zero external dependencies** — no OpenZeppelin, no forge-std submodule for `src/` | `forge build` must work from a clean clone with no submodule fetch. |
| D4 | **Text lives on-chain as strings; hashes are derived by the contract** | The contract computes `sha256(bytes(text))` itself at write time, so the frontend never hashes and can never desync. Text is bounded (≤500 + 4×200 chars), so testnet gas is trivial. |
| D5 | **The contract owns the bond economics, not the UI** | Bond bps is set at deploy; bond math is on-chain. |
| D6 | **`UNDETERMINED` releases to the seller and returns the bond to the buyer** | Full reasoning in `docs/DATA_MODEL.md` §6. Short version: an inconclusive judgment does not establish a breach, and paying ambiguity the same as `FULL_REFUND` would make griefing free. |
| D7 | **An offer is a single-slot purchase record, not a stock item** | Matches the inspection-record metaphor. No marketplace browsing (explicitly out of scope). |
| D8 | **Wallet connect is `viem` + `window.ethereum` directly — no wagmi, no RainbowKit** | Keeps the frontend dependency tree tiny so Vercel builds are fast and a version-churn bug can't sink the demo. |
| D9 | **The relayer is a standalone Node process, not a Vercel function** | Vercel serverless can't hold the long-lived watcher GenLayer finality needs. |
| D10 | **`settle()` requires *both* `msg.sender == relayer` *and* a valid relayer signature** | Build spec §4.7 says only the relayer signature can call settlement; §4.1 says verify the relayer's message. Requiring both satisfies either reading and costs one comparison. A signature-only gate would make settlement permissionless — defensible as meta-transaction relaying, but it means a decision the relayer signed and then reconsidered can be pushed by anyone who saw it. Neither gate can change *what* a decision says, only whether it can be delivered. |
| D11 | **`src/` has zero Solidity dependencies; `forge-std` is installed by CI, not committed** | `contracts/lib/` is gitignored and the escrow imports nothing external, so a clean clone builds with no submodules. Only the test suite needs `forge-std`, so CI runs `forge install foundry-rs/forge-std --no-commit` before `forge test`. |

## The relayer is a trust boundary — never claim otherwise

This is the single most important thing to get right in the README and demo.

Base **cannot** verify GenLayer finality from inside an EVM contract. The
`SettlementDecision.finalized` field is an assertion by the relayer. Everything
else in the decision *is* verified on-chain (see `docs/SECURITY.md`), but
`finalized` is not.

**Required wording:** "the relayer is a trusted prototype component; this is
testnet-only." Do **not** describe the system as trustless. The build spec is
explicit that overclaiming here is the failure mode to avoid.

## GenLayer Consensus v0.6 — the parts that change our code

Source: https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/consensus-v06-migration

| Item | Rule |
|:--|:--|
| Version family | Consensus v0.6 RC + Studio v0.123 RC + `genlayer-js` v2.0 RC + CLI v0.40 RC. **Install one coherent RC set; pin exact versions.** Prerelease tags must be requested explicitly — `latest` will *not* resolve to the RC. |
| Preview network | **studio-dev** — RPC `https://studio-dev.genlayer.com/api`, chain ID **61997**. Separate from stable Studionet (**61999**). |
| Network selection | Use `studioDevnet` / `studio-dev` for the preview. **Never** point the stable `studionet` chain object at the preview RPC — chain identity and consensus contract addresses move together. |
| Fees | Every deploy and write on a fee-charging deployment must carry a `FeesDistribution` and its quoted fee value. Build a `fee-profile.json` with `gltest --fee-profile`, convert a profile entry into live estimate options, read current prices/caps through the SDK estimate, then submit the returned `distribution` and `feeValue` **unchanged**. A Studio deployment can be gasless — detect that from the estimate result, **not** from the network name. |
| Appeals | Use `client.getAppealCharge({txId})` then `client.appealTransaction({txId, value: charge})`. Direct `submitAppeal` can revert with `AppealRoundNotPermitted`. Successful appeal pays 2.5× bond total (principal + 1.5× profit). |
| Success test | A tx is successful **only** if status is `ACCEPTED`/`FINALIZED` **and** execution result is `FINISHED_WITH_RETURN`. Use the SDK `isSuccessful` helper. Status alone is not success. |
| Appeal rounds | Verified escalation is **5 → 11 → 23** validators. Never hardcode a smaller sequence, never assume a fixed appeal duration — read it from protocol state. |
| Storage | Studio-dev may reset. Bradbury is the durable target only once v0.6 is promoted there. |

## Key addresses and paths

### Testnet keys — in `.secrets/`, gitignored, testnet only

| Role | Address |
|:--|:--|
| Deployer | `0xe5Fe9119000C9E1113dc504891A83Da7bbaa7a7b` |
| Relayer signer | `0x49B4f09C5894c1C90B0ca9099AF3De0Faf7f3037` |

The relayer address must be passed to the escrow constructor. Regenerate with
`node scripts/gen-wallet.mjs --out .secrets` (refuses to overwrite existing
files).

> The key generator (`scripts/gen-wallet.mjs`) implements Keccak-256 and
> secp256k1 address derivation from scratch on top of Node builtins. Its
> correctness is pinned by published test vectors — **run
> `node scripts/gen-wallet.mjs --self-test` before trusting any address it
> prints.** A transposed rotation table in the Keccak permutation still
> produces a plausible-looking address; it is simply the wrong one.

### Known non-secret addresses

| Thing | Address |
|:--|:--|
| Base Sepolia USDC | `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` |
| RecourseEscrow (Base Sepolia) | _not yet deployed_ |
| GenLayer judgment contract | _not yet deployed_ |

## Repository shape

```
contracts/   Foundry project — Base escrow (Solidity, zero deps)
genlayer/    Intelligent contract (Python / GenVM) — the judgment layer
relayer/     Node service — GenLayer -> Base bridge
frontend/    Next.js App Router + Tailwind — deployed to Vercel
scripts/     local utilities (key generation)
docs/        DATA_MODEL.md, SECURITY.md, DEPLOY.md
.github/     CI — all heavy compute runs here
```

## Open questions / not yet decided

- Which GenLayer network the demo targets: stable Studionet (61999) vs
  studio-dev (61997). Chain config is built to switch by env var so this can be
  decided late.
- Whether a GenLayer contract deploy requires a fee on the target network (the
  migration doc says detect gaslessness from the estimate, not the name).
- **Blocked on the user:** the GitHub token lacks the `workflow` scope, so
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` cannot be pushed until they run
  `gh auth refresh -s workflow`. CI is the only place the Solidity and GenVM
  code actually compiles, so nothing is verified until this is done. The current
  workflow file exists only in the working tree.
